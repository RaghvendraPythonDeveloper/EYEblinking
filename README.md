# Eye Blinking Detection Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects and counts eye blinks in real-time using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**. It helps monitor eye health, suggests blinking reminders, and can be integrated into eye strain prevention applications.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Real-time eye blink detection** using OpenCV and MediaPipe
- 📊 **Blink counter** to track blinking patterns
- 🔔 **Alerts** when the user doesn't blink for a long time
- 📝 **Stores blink data** in a text file for analysis
- 🖥️ **Lightweight and efficient**, runs on standard hardware
